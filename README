ABOUT

A collection of OEIS <https://oeis.org/> integer sequence generators coded
in C using LibTomMath.

GETTING STARTED

1. Get LibTomMath

   git clone https://github.com/libtom/libtommath.git

2. Build LibTomMath

   [n]make [-f makefile.gcc] libtommath

3. Generate sequence (simplified, does not require LibTomMath)

   [n]make [-f makefile.gcc] aNNNNNN

4. Generate b-file (requires LibTomMath)

   [n]make [-f makefile.gcc] bNNNNNN

INCLUDED SEQUENCES

A050970 - Favard constant (numerators).
A050971 - Favard constant (denominators).
A276321 - B-spline interpolation matrices.
